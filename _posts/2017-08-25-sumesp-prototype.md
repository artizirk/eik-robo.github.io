We've had eye on those 4-dollar ESP32 modules
for quite some time and now we have something
to show off!
Kudos to Silver for designing the PCB and Marek for creating the 3D model
for the case. Lauri was in this case as usual the master of disaster.

Here's some pictures of the PCB, the board is quite usable for other purposes
as well:

At the moment we have a usable webpage for uploading Python 
code to the robot using WebSockets via an nginx/nchan installation
and the code will be interpreted by the on-board MicroPython.
We'll be back soon with more information and we're confident we
can offer a decent sumorobot kit for 30 EUR,
until then keep an eye on the relevalt
