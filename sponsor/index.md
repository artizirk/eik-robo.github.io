If you're interested in becoming a sponsor contact us at <a href="mailto:meelis.antoi@itcollege.ee">meelis.antoi@itcollege.ee</a>

For sponsors we provide visibility at annual [Robotex](http://www.robotex.ee/) robotics competition and
in the Robotics Club rooms among the bright students of [Estonian IT College](http://www.itcollege.ee/).
In January of 2016 we registered legal entity MTÜ IT Kolledži Robootikaklubi
in Estonia and we can issue invoices.
The non-profit organization was founded by 12 club members and
Lauri Võsandi is serving as board member.

We are also interested in e-junk - please give us a call on +372 628 5868
if you could offer us computer screens,
keyboards, mice, servers, embedded devices, drill benches, power supplies etc.
You can also offer shelves and other stuff that might come handy for stuff that we do.
