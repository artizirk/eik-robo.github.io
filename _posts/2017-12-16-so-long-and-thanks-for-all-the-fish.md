The non-profit organization created to manage resources for the Robotics Club
has outgrown the scope of robotics and we're moving to a new location with
a new name [k-space.ee](http://k-space.ee).

Meelis Antoi will take over the Robotics Club rooms 412 and 413 starting from January 2018.
Lauri will continue at Akadeemia tee 21/1 fifth floor.
All Robotics Club current members and alumni are very much welcome to join us at Akadeemia tee 21/1.
If you're interested in building basketball robot or tackle some other interesting challenges you can reach Lauri via the
contacts at [k-space.ee](http://k-space.ee).
