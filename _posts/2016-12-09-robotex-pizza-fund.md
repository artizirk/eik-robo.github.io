Food expenses for Robotex 2016 have been pretty high, more than 500€ in total.
Couple times a week we ordered pizza from Pööning,
grabbed some asian food from Drumsticks or
simply bought stuff from Selver.

Pizza fund contributors:

* Valdur Kaldvee 83€
* Arti Zirk 60€
* Mikk Mangus 32€
* Allan Vein 20€
* Madis Toom 20€
* Tauri Metsoja 20€
* Erki Naumanis 20€
* Silver Kuusik 10€
* Lauri Võsandi the rest

Thank you guys, you're the best! :)
